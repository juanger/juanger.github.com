{"pageProps":{"title":"Accepted into GSoC!","contents":" <p>This year my luck changed (well, maybe what changed was that my application was better than last year’s :)) and I’ve been accepted to work for the MacPorts project. I wanted to collaborate with MacPorts since some time ago and this is a very good chance to begin helping.</p>\n<p>I’ll be implementing the Cocoa <span class='caps'>GUI</span> of MacPorts using the framework developed by Randall Wood and George Armah. Before sending my proposal, I began coding a sample application (<a href='http://juanger.googlepages.com/Porton-app.zip'>Porton.app</a>, it only works on intel-Leopard) and I’d love to hear or read any comment and suggestion to improve the <span class='caps'>GUI</span> and thus, I’ll do some releases for testing purposes for the community as the app gets implemented.</p>\n<p>To all the accepted students: Congrats and good luck in your projects!!</p>\n<p>To everyone that was rejected: :( I know how you feel, last year I wasn’t accepted and what bugged me the most was that who was selected didn’t made a good work in the project that I applied for and as I focused in my school courses, I didn’t help either. All I can say now is that I’ll do my best so that if you applied for the same project as me, you won’t feel as I felt last year and that I’ll do my best to help the MacPorts community.</p>\n","categories":["MacPorts","gsoc"],"comments":false,"date":"2009-04-24","lang":"en"},"__N_SSG":true}
