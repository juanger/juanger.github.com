{"pageProps":{"title":"One week till Midterm evaluation!","contents":"<p>I've been very busy in the last month and I haven't had the time to post here.</p>\n\n<p>I love to learn new things and sometimes that's the reason I don't have enough time. I'm learning Cocoa, Objective-C and Tcl (just a little) and If if you think that's enough, read this: I can now watch the WWDC sessions videos and learn even more!</p>\n\n<p>I should have been there and know all that by now, but the US Embassy in Mexico denied me a visa :( (beleive be! I'm not a \"MOJADO\"!! :) )</p>\n\n<p>So, for anyone wondering how does the MacPorts GUI application I'm working on looks like now here it is a little screenshot (click it to see it bigger):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://content.screencast.com/users/juanger/folders/Jing/media/c35f7ed9-876d-4acb-ab87-7c1b8f958ab2/00000001.png\"><img class=\"embeddedObject\" src=\"http://content.screencast.com/users/juanger/folders/Jing/media/c35f7ed9-876d-4acb-ab87-7c1b8f958ab2/00000001.png\" width=\"300\" border=\"0\" /></a></p>\n<p>There's still a lot of work to be done (including some major changes in how the MacPorts framework sends notifications) but I hope to be releasing a usable app after the midterm week. I also made a weekly list of tasks and published here: <a href=\"http://juanger.heroku.com/gsoc-09\">Tasks</a></p>\n\n<p>Till then!</p>\n","categories":[],"comments":false,"date":"2009-07-01","slug":"one-week-till-midterm-evaluation","lang":"en"},"__N_SSG":true}
