<p>A few days ago, <a href="http://blog.jasoncrystal.com/?p=7">Jason Crystal wrote in his blog</a> a way to package rails applications in a Mac OS X one and I commented that I've been developing an application called RoRGate to automate that with another process.</p><p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://github.com/juanger/rorgate/tree/master%2Fmeta%2Fimages%2FRoRGate-v0.2.png?raw=true"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 497px; height: 236px;" src="http://github.com/juanger/rorgate/tree/master%2Fmeta%2Fimages%2FRoRGate-v0.2.png?raw=true" alt="" border="0" /></a></p><p>I'll be posting more news about it as I improve my implementation. Today I added the posibility to manage multiple windows in a Gate(the resulting OS X app). Also, the RoRGate-dev.dmg will be the unsable version with all the latest changes, so if want to try the newest features you'll have to download it and not the versioned one.</p><p>The DMGs will be hosted (by now) in:</p><p></p><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/rorgate/">http://code.google.com/p/rorgate/</a></p><p>The source code in:</p><p><a href="http://github.com/juanger/rorgate/tree/master">http://github.com/juanger/rorgate/tree/master</a></p><p>I'd appreciate if you can send me any errors or comments to improve it.</p></div>
