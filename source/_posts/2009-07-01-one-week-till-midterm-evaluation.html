<p>I've been very busy in the last month and I haven't had the time to post here.</p> 

<p>I love to learn new things and sometimes that's the reason I don't have enough time. I'm learning Cocoa, Objective-C and Tcl (just a little) and If if you think that's enough, read this: I can now watch the WWDC sessions videos and learn even more!</p>

<p>I should have been there and know all that by now, but the US Embassy in Mexico denied me a visa :( (beleive be! I'm not a "MOJADO"!! :) )</p>

<p>So, for anyone wondering how does the MacPorts GUI application I'm working on looks like now here it is a little screenshot (click it to see it bigger):</p>

<p>There's still a lot of work to be done (including some major changes in how the MacPorts framework sends notifications) but I hope to be releasing a usable app after the midterm week. I also made a weekly list of tasks and published here: <a href="http://juanger.heroku.com/gsoc-09">Tasks</a></p>


<p>Till then!</p></div>
