I've been very busy this months and I haven't prepared the screencast, but here is a little present, the new version of Lucecita:

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juanger/2976552527/" title="Lucecita.app 2.0 by Juanger, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3235/2976552527_8a9defd15f_o.png" width="221" height="334" alt="Lucecita.app 2.0" /></a>

All the source code is hosted in github at <a href="http://github.com/juanger/lucecita">http://github.com/juanger/lucecita</a> and the DMG is here: <a href="http://github.com/juanger/lucecita/tree/master%2FLucecita.dmg?raw=true">Lucecita.dmg</a>

It's a universal binary and only works in Leopard.

Enjoy it!!</div>
